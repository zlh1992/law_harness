Example Usage:
    >>> from semantica.context import AgentContext, ContextGraph
    >>> # Simple AgentContext with decision tracking

    ...                       decision_tracking=True,
    ...                       advanced_analytics=True,
    ...                       kg_algorithms=True,
    ...                       vector_store_features=True)
    >>> memory_id = context.store("User asked about Python", conversation_id="conv1")
    >>> results = context.retrieve("Python programming")
    >>> decision_id = context.record_decision(category="approval", 
    ...                                      scenario="Loan application",
    ...                                      reasoning="Good credit score",
    ...                                      outcome="approved",
    ...                                      confidence=0.95)
    >>> precedents = context.find_precedents_advanced("Loan application", 
    ...                                               category="approval",
    ...                                               use_kg_features=True)
    >>> influence = context.analyze_decision_influence(decision_id)
    >>> insights = context.get_context_insights()
    
    >>> # Comprehensive ContextGraph with all decision features
    >>> graph = ContextGraph(advanced_analytics=True, enable_causality=True)
    >>> decision_id = graph.record_decision(
    ...     category="loan_approval",
    ...     scenario="First-time homebuyer",
    ...     reasoning="Good credit score and stable income",
    ...     outcome="approved",
    ...     confidence=0.95,
    ...     entities=["customer_123", "property_456"]
    ... )
    >>> precedents = graph.find_precedents("loan_approval", limit=5)
    >>> influence = graph.analyze_decision_influence(decision_id)
    >>> insights = graph.get_decision_insights()
    >>> causality = graph.trace_decision_causality(decision_id)
