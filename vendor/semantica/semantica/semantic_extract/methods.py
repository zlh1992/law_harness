TEMPORAL EXTRACTION RULES:
- valid_from: ISO 8601 date or exact phrase from the text for when this relation became valid. Set to null if no temporal signal is present.
- valid_until: ISO 8601 date or exact phrase for when this relation ceased. Set to null if open-ended or absent.
- temporal_confidence (float 0.0–1.0) — calibrated as follows:
    1.00 = full ISO date ("2022-03-15", "March 15, 2022")
    0.90 = explicit year + month ("March 2022", "2022-03")
    0.85 = explicit year only ("in 2022", "since 2021", "from 2019")
    0.75 = quarter ("Q3 2023", "Q2 2021")
    0.65 = named season or approximate range ("summer 2022", "early 2020s", "mid-2022")
    0.50 = vague relative with computable anchor ("last year", "three months ago")
    0.35 = highly vague relative ("recently", "years ago", "in the past")
    0.00 = no temporal signal present for this relation
- temporal_source_text: the EXACT verbatim substring from the source text that contains the temporal signal. Set to null when temporal_confidence is 0.0.

IMPORTANT: Do NOT invent or guess dates. If the text contains no temporal signal for a relation, set valid_from and valid_until to null and temporal_confidence to 0.0.

Few-shot examples (do NOT include these in your output):
  Text: "Apple acquired Beats in May 2014."
  → valid_from: "2014-05-01", valid_until: null, temporal_confidence: 0.90, temporal_source_text: "May 2014"

  Text: "The CEO has led the company since Q3 2020."
  → valid_from: "Q3 2020", valid_until: null, temporal_confidence: 0.75, temporal_source_text: "since Q3 2020"

  Text: "Last year, Google partnered with Samsung."
  → valid_from: "last year", valid_until: null, temporal_confidence: 0.50, temporal_source_text: "Last year"

  Text: "The firm was under enhanced supervision between Q2 and Q4 2021."
  → valid_from: "Q2 2021", valid_until: "Q4 2021", temporal_confidence: 0.75, temporal_source_text: "between Q2 and Q4 2021"

  Text: "Microsoft develops Windows."
  → valid_from: null, valid_until: null, temporal_confidence: 0.00, temporal_source_text: null
